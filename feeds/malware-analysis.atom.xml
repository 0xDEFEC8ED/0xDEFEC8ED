I never saw him as a security enthusiast but he knew that I have always been interested in that stuff. I had worked with a lot of languages on different projects till that moment but when I saw his script, I laughed. It was a funny little logic bomb. but I still felt annoyed by the fact that I didn't knew the motive of his new skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 years ago, I was still cracking the doors of Reverse engineering when I realised that one of the major applications of this skillset was malware and ransomware analysis. This got me interested in malware analysis and I wanted to skip the basics and directly jump onto this hype train which was brought upon by the infamous wannacry malware.&lt;/p&gt;
